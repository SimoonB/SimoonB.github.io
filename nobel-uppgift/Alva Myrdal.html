			<h2>	Disarmament and Nuclear Weapons-Free Zones  </h2>
			<br>
                    Alva Myrdal already had an extensive career behind her when she was elected to the Swedish "riksdag" (legislative assembly) in 1962. She had studied 			 					philology and pedagogy, and in the inter-war years devoted herself to improving the conditions of the working class through the Social Democrat       				Party. She also made a name for herself as a campaigner for women's rights.
			<p>
					After World War II, Alva Myrdal held prominent posts in the United Nations system, hand-picked by the Secretary-General. She was among other things 			 					head of UNESCO's social science section. From 1955 she was Swedish Ambassador to India.
            <p>
            
            		It was, however, as the government minister in charge of disarmament issues that Alva Myrdal really stood out as an innovator. As the representative 				 					of a non-aligned Sweden, she worked actively to persuade the superpowers to disarm. The nuclear race was a major concern, and she fought for nuclear  					weapons-free zones in Europe. Each individual country ought to take the initiative and ban nuclear arms on its territory.
